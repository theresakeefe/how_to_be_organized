		<p>Loosing remotes and game controllers, and flipping the house upside down looking fo them can be such a pain! By putting a piece of velcro on the back of a remote, and a piece of velcro in the cabinet, or on the table will help you never loose a remote again!!! <p/>

	<p>Stepping on Barbie shoes, or even legos can really hurt! By hangning a shoe organizer on the door, and organizing your children's toys in them will help prevent stepping on toys, now since there is a place for the toys other then the floor. <p/>
