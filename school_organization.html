    	<p>Pens and Pencil drawers can be unorganized, dirty, and messy.  By getting big masson jars, putting a chalkboard sticky on the masson jar, and labeling it weather it's  pencils, pens, markers, ect. will make homework much easier. Also, to make this DIY organizational project fun, you can have your kids help decorate the mason jars with either stickers, or ribbon.  </p>

    	<p>Remembering to write passwords down, is a sour subject for a lot of people. To make it easier, especially for kids making accounts in school, like email, math facts, ect. save your old paint swatches, and staple them all together, so your children have a fun and organized spot for all of their passwords.  </p>

    	<p>When it's homework time, it can be very unorganized, especially if you have more then one child. By having an area for your children to work, and color coating supplies for each child, will make homework time much more organized.   </p>

    	<p>If you have extra closet room, then use it for School information, and supplies. You can separate things, with different labels, and colors, so your children know what is due that day, or what they need for homework that night. </p>

    	<p>To help not loose book bags, lunch boxes, or folders, hang hooks, and white boards rights next to the door, so when your kids walk in form school, the first things that the kids do is hang everything up. By hanging a white board, you can write what is due that day, so no one forgets. </p>
